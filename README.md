# EasyOutline
A quick start for Outline WIKI and iFramely

## iFramely setup

This pulls a Dockerfile (hosted inside ./iframely/dockerfile)
And builds it as iframely:iframely:latest

## Outline Setup

This is a shell script which ask you for a SMTP Credentials and configures local storage inside the docker.env file, that outline uses.

## Why did I do this?

I struggled with the setup of Outline TBH and wanted it to make it as easy as it can get.
